Command Line Adventure game using Java
The program will allow players to type full words, or phrases, then move to the correct location based upon your input.
The player should be able to type commands such as "Go West", "run South", or just "East" and the program will move to the appropriate location if there is one.  
An attempt to move in an invalid direction should print a message and remain in the same place.
